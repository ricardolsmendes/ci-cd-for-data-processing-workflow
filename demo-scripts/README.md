# Demo scripts

A demo session usually comprises all the steps described in the
[Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for your data-processing
workflow](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/cicd-pipeline-for-data-processing)
reference guide. We strongly recommend following and understanding all the
instructions before running a demo!

The scripts in this folder are intended to expedite demo sessions given you
have the environment properly set up (buckets, Compose environment, and so on).
That said, open a new Cloud Shell, copy, and paste the commands in the
specified order (one at a time). Run all commands from the
`ci-cd-for-data-processing-workflow` parent folder.
